# DataAnalysis
Practice task for course(https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/)
## First HW (Descriptive statistics. Quantiles, quartiles. Histograms.)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3730/

>Task: Find a pair of datasets and plot a distribution histogram for them in Python.
## Second HW (Descriptive statistics. Boxplots. Outliers.)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3731/

> Task: Use a variety of descriptive statistics (which were presented in the lectures) to compare products and restaurants.


> Datasets: SALE_LIST.CSV, PRODUCT_LIST.CSV 
## Third HW (Hierarchical cluster analysis.)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3813/


> Task: The file ALL_SPB_STOPS.CSV contains information about the stops of ground transport in St. Petersburg and metro stations (indicating longitude and latitude). Metro station identifiers start with 100***. Select the neighborhood of a metro within a radius of about 1000 meters and try to cluster the stops within this radius by coordinates. Demonstrate the clustering result (write down the names of the stops in the cluster explicitly or draw on the map).


## Fourth HW (K-means method.)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3829/


> Task: The file ALL_SPB_STOPS.CSV (from the previous task) contains information about the stops of ground transport in St. Petersburg and metro stations (indicating longitude and latitude). Metro station identifiers start with 100***. Select the neighborhood of a metro station within a radius of about 1000 meters and try to cluster by the K-means method the stops within this radius by coordinates. Demonstrate the clustering result (write down the names of the stops in the cluster explicitly or draw on the map).

## Fifth, Sixth HWs (Statistical Hypothesis Testing. Theoretical Introduction.)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3850/


> There is no practical task for this lecture.
## Seventh HW (A / B testing. Proportion test.)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3860/


> Task: The folder contains the texts of two plays by Shakespeare, very famous, but different translators. What will A / B testing show?
## Eight HW (Linear regression).
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3900/


> Task: 
> Build three models to predict the price of apartments:
> 
> 1. Based on the number of meters;
> 2. Based on the distance to the metro;
> 3. Based on square meters & metro distance;

> Further:
> 1. For cases 1 and 2, plot the baseline and projected values.
> 2. Compare baseline and predicted values using quality metrics (all 12 metrics mentioned in the presentation for all models).

## Ninth HW (Forecasting based on a regression model with seasonal indicator (fictitious, structural) variables
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3921/

> In the file electric_power.xml - data on the hourly electricity consumption for two years.
Aggregate the data to daily consumption. Forecast consumption 7 days ahead. Evaluate the quality of the forecast using a couple of metrics.
Show the result visually on a graph.

## Tenth HW (Classification and regression trees)
> Video: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3922/

> Task: 
> 1. Build a classification tree for a dataset from an article.
> 2. Assess the quality of the classification.
> 3. Assess the significance of the variables.

## Eleventh HW (Random forest)
> Videos: https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3953/
> https://compscicenter.ru/courses/data-mining-python/2018-spring/classes/3957/

> Task: Apply RandomForest. Assess the classification accuracy.
